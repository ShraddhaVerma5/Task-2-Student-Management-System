# Task-2-Student-Management-System

📌 Objective
    To build a Command Line Interface (CLI) based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system in Java for managing student records such as ID, name, and marks.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
    Programming Language: Java

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition

Data Structure Used: ArrayList

🧾 Features
    ➕ Add Student Record
    👁️ View All Records
    ✏️ Update Student Record
    ❌ Delete Student Record
    🚪 Exit the Program

🧑‍💻 How It Works
     The program displays a menu of available actions.
     The user selects an option (Add/View/Update/Delete/Exit).
     Student data is stored dynamically using an ArrayList.
     The loop continues until the user exits the application.
